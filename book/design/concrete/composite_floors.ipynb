    "Corrugated, galvanized steel sheets with a thickness of 0,7 to 1,2 mm act as lost formwork and reinforcement for the composite floor. In principle the steel plates act as\n",
    "the main reinforcement. The extra reinforcement shown in the pictures prevents excessive cracking and has a beneficial effect of the behaviour of the flour under fire conditions. As\n",
    "a rule of thumb the thickness of the floor can be estimated as 1/30 of the span. Depending on the thickness of the floor, free spans up to 3,25 m are\n",
    "possible. If temporary supports are used the spans can increase up to 9,60 m. Whether the concrete floor is connected with shear connectors\n",
    "(studs) to the steel support beams or not determines the force distribution. If the shear studs are applied, the steel beam acts as tensile chord\n",
    "and the concrete will take up all the compression. A composite beam is formed. If no shear studs are applied, the beam and floor act separately. If\n",
    "the shear studs are highly loaded it is recommended to weld them directly to the beam, instead of welding them to the beam through the steel plates.\n",
    "Composite floors can also be applied in combination with integrated beams, where the corrugated sheet is placed on the widened bottom flange of a\n",
    "profile. Voids in the floor are provided with formwork to contain the wet concrete.\n",
