# Syntax exercises

The previous exercise guide you through making your own book following the TeachBooks workflow. Now lets get specific and dive into the possibilities of the syntax used!

As user type 3 you will work primarily in `.md` (Markdown) or `.ipynb`(Jupyter Notebook) files. In TeachBooks, `.md` files contain text-based content with formatting, while `ipynb` files contain both text and executable code cells. `.md` files are much easier to edit online, so let's start with those!

The more you write, the more different types of content you'll want to use. [JupyterBook v1 itself provides a cheatsheet](https://jupyterbook.org/v1/reference/cheatsheet.html) which will come in handy!
