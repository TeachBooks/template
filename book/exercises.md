Getting used to the syntax of writing in a Jupyter Book can be a bit daunting at the start, not to mention becoming familiar with the various tools and workflows required. To help make the learning curve somewhat easier to travel, a number of exercises have been prepared for you as part. The exercises are designed such that no prior experience with any tools or programming is required, as long as you have read the preceding introductory pages. We welcome you to work through the exercises attached to this page (you can find them in the left sidebar).

```{tip}
Maybe you're already comfortable with Git, GitHub and the concept of using software to parse text-based files and create marked-up documents. In that case, can you answer the following questions (referring to the exercises):
1. Can you add some content to the intro page?
2. Can you add the file named `file_to_be_added_to_toc.md` to the book website?
3. Can you edit the repository url defined in the `_config.yml`, change the title shown below the logo and change the author as shown in the footer?
4. Can you make a new branch of your book with an additional file `file_on_new_version.md` and view it online?
5. Can you merge your branch into `main` with a pull request?
6. Can you fork someone else's repo, and suggest a change in a pull request?

If something is not clear, dive into to the relevant exercise page.
