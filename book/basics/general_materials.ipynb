    "| Self Weight        | Small (4 to 10 kN/m³, depending on the species)  | Large (78.5 kN/m³) but relatively low self weight, large spans are possible (optimized cross sections); steel use per m² roof area: 0.3 to 1 kN | Large (24 kN/m³), this has consequences for the foundation and maximum span; not economical with low variable load | Large (24 kN/m³), this has consequences for the foundation dimensions; fairly large, but favorable with respect to buckling and deformation limits |\n",
    "| Fire Resistance    | Small dimensions have low fire resistance; Larger sections have good fire resistance | The structure has low fire resistance, but does not burn itself | Good resistance if the cover is sufficient | Less resistance than in situ concrete due to deterioration of the prestressing steel. Does not collapse easily, but is not reliable after a fire |\n",
    "| Water Tightness    | Dependent on the application                      | Not applicable                                    | Good                                             | Good                                             |\n",
    "| Thermal Properties | Not susceptible to thermal influences              | Sensitive to temperature changes; bad without insulation | Low thermal insulation, beware of thermal bridges | Low thermal insulation, beware of thermal bridges |\n",
    "| Acoustic Properties| Acceptable to good; sound reflection is high with corrugated sheet metal in roofs and walls | Air sound insulation is good, contact sound insulation is bad | Air sound insulation is good, contact sound insulation is bad | Adaptability in relation to doors, windows, etc. is good, if the appropriate measures are taken in advance |\n",
    "| Adaptability       | Good                                              | Good                                              | Good, if the appropriate measures are taken in advance | Standard product; tolerances must be incorporated in the design |\n",
    "| Adaptability to ducts             | Trusses are especially suitable for carrying trough of ducts; connection can be done fairly easy | Information is needed upfront and must be processed very accurately. After casting, extra measures are difficult to incorporate | Limited possibilities upfront. After casting, adaption is very difficult | Low                                        |\n",

    "| Labour intensity                 | See steel. A lot of preparation in the factory, resulting in fast and simple assembly on site | The formwork and falsework are very labour intensive. If possible, use standard formwork. Avoid small amounts of concrete at great heights | Factory product with fast assembly on site. Extra stressing on site requires specialized tools and crew | N/A                                                      |\n",
    "| Necessity of serial production   | Not necessary                                            | Not necessary                                            | Preferred, but less necessary than with prefab concrete  | Necessary, because of the high costs of moulds          |\n",
    "| Residual value after demolition  | Low positive residual value, but demolition is easy      | Positive residual value; demolition is expensive         | Negative residual value                                  | N/A                                                      |\n",
