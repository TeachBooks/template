# Flood Management Case Study

```{note}
The flood management example is covered in the plenary lecture on Jan 9, 2023 (see Brightspace), and has not yet been added to this book.
```

As mentioned on Introduction page:
> Throughout this book we will repeatedly draw on the field of flood management to illustrate risk and reliability concepts as this field requires expertise from all perspectives in civil and environmental engineering and geosciences, from climate and hydrologic processes to evacuation and recovery. 

<!-- After introducing key elements of the system, topics may include:
- hazard
- levee failure, conditional on the hazard
- consequences
- integration (sum) to get risk
- assume we can establish a max value, then we can derive the required safety level for our levee
- fragility curve -->
