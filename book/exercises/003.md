# Exercise 3: Change book configuration

As we've added some content by now, let's make this book a bit more personal! We'll make some changes to the `_config.yml` file which changes the configuration of the book website. 

> Can you edit the repository url defined in the `_config.yml`, change the title shown below the logo and change the author as shown in the footer?

1. Go to the the file `book/_config.yml` on your GitHub repository - {octicon}`code;1em` `Code` - `Book` - `_config.yml` - {octicon}`pencil;1em` `Edit this file`
2. In the `Edit` field, change the author which will be shown in the footer of the book website.

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: note

Before moving on to the next exercise, make sure you understand the following:
- What is this special `_config.yml` file?
- Changes in `_config.yml` can have effect on multiple pages in the book
- The `_config.yml` is generally not used for adding content
