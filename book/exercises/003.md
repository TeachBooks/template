# Exercise 3: Change book configuration

:class: note

Before moving on to the next exercise, make sure you understand the following:
- What is this special `_config.yml` file?
- Changes in `_config.yml` can have effect on multiple pages in the book
- The `_config.yml` is generally not used for adding content
