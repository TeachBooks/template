# Template

_Update: Feb 23 transferred files from [Risk and Reliability Book](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg/risk-and-reliability/) to set things up._

This will be the future home of the template book. Design philosophy:
- people will fork this to create a book in as easy-as-possible a way
- minimal changes should be made to the book contents itself, to prevent downstream merge conflicts
- focus is mostly on providing a clean and simply view to the key features in our book repo (e.g., config files, scripts, markup flags, etc)
